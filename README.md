# Final-project

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

This is my Final Project for the Fullstack Developer training program at Hamburg Coding School. The website manages a travel blog. It was programmed using Vue.js, Java script, HTML and CSS for the front end and Javascript, Express.js and mssql2 for the back end.
